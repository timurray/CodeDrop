COMP 4770 - Team C - Server Deployment

Requirements:
	- Tested on Ubuntu 14.04.3.
	- Should work on any semi-recent Ubuntu or Debian system without issue.
	- Also made to work on Mac and Windows systems with npm.
	- Latest NodeJS/npm in Ubuntu repos.
	- Express, bodyparse, sqlite, formidable.

Steps (for Linux, similar ideas for other OSes):
	1) Change to ./CodeDrop/server/
	2) sudo apt-get install npm
	3) sudo npm install
		a) 	If you get an error about sqlite3 not installing, try
				sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
			as there is a small naming issue between nodejs versions
			(it's now just node, rather than node js). Linking between the two
			fixes this for older versions of NodeJS.
	4) nodejs server.js
